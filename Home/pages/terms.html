        <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
        <p class="page-subtitle">Last updated: February 9, 2026</p>

        <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
        <p>By accessing or using Elderos ("the Service"), including the game client, launcher, website, and all related services operated by Elderos ("we", "us", "our"), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service. If you do not agree, you must stop using the Service immediately.</p>

        <h2>2. Eligibility</h2>
        <p>You must be at least 13 years of age to use the Service. By creating an account, you represent that you meet this requirement. If you are under 18, you confirm that a parent or guardian has reviewed and agreed to these terms on your behalf.</p>

        <h2>3. Account Ownership</h2>
        <p>All accounts are the property of Elderos. You are granted a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use your account. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your login credentials.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You may not share, sell, trade, or transfer your account to another person.</li>
            <li>You are responsible for all activity that occurs under your account.</li>
            <li>We reserve the right to suspend or terminate any account at our sole discretion.</li>
            <li>We strongly recommend enabling two-factor authentication (2FA) to protect your account.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Virtual Items & Currency</h2>
        <p>All virtual items, currency (including Eldercoins), ranks, and in-game assets are the property of Elderos. You do not own any virtual items — you are granted a limited license to use them within the Service.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Virtual items have no real-world monetary value.</li>
            <li>You may not sell, trade, or exchange virtual items for real-world currency or goods ("Real-World Trading" or "RWT").</li>
            <li>We may modify, remove, or reset virtual items at any time without notice or compensation.</li>
            <li>Purchases of Eldercoins or donator ranks are final and non-transferable.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. Acceptable Use</h2>
        <p>When using the Service, you agree not to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Use any automated software, bots, macros, or third-party tools to gain an unfair advantage.</li>
            <li>Exploit bugs, glitches, or unintended mechanics. You must report bugs promptly.</li>
            <li>Harass, threaten, or abuse other players or staff members.</li>
            <li>Use offensive, discriminatory, or inappropriate language or usernames.</li>
            <li>Impersonate staff members or other players.</li>
            <li>Attempt to access accounts that do not belong to you.</li>
            <li>Distribute malware, phishing links, or other harmful content.</li>
            <li>Interfere with or disrupt the Service or its infrastructure.</li>
            <li>Reverse-engineer, decompile, or modify the game client or server software.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>6. Enforcement & Punishments</h2>
        <p>Violations of these terms may result in action taken against your account, including but not limited to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Warning</strong> — A formal notice of the violation.</li>
            <li><strong>Mute</strong> — Temporary or permanent restriction of chat privileges.</li>
            <li><strong>Timeout</strong> — Temporary restriction from gameplay.</li>
            <li><strong>Temporary Ban</strong> — Account suspension for a specified duration.</li>
            <li><strong>Permanent Ban</strong> — Indefinite account suspension.</li>
            <li><strong>IP Ban</strong> — Restriction of all accounts from your network.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We reserve the right to apply punishments at our discretion. Punishments may be applied without prior warning depending on the severity of the offense.</p>

        <h2>7. Purchases & Payments</h2>
        <p>Purchases are processed through Stripe. By making a purchase, you agree to Stripe's terms of service. All purchases of digital goods (Eldercoins, donator ranks, cosmetic items) are considered final upon delivery. See our <a href="/pages/refund.html">Refund Policy</a> for details on eligibility for refunds.</p>

        <h2>8. Intellectual Property</h2>
        <p>Elderos is a fan-made project. All original content, including but not limited to custom artwork, code, website design, and written content, is the intellectual property of Elderos. Old School RuneScape and RuneScape are trademarks of Jagex Ltd. We are not affiliated with, endorsed by, or associated with Jagex Ltd.</p>

        <h2>9. Service Availability</h2>
        <p>We strive to keep the Service available at all times but do not guarantee uninterrupted access. We may perform maintenance, updates, or modifications that temporarily affect availability. We are not liable for any loss resulting from downtime or service interruptions.</p>

        <h2>10. Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>The Service is provided "as is" and "as available" without warranties of any kind, express or implied. To the maximum extent permitted by law, Elderos shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, consequential, or punitive damages arising from your use of the Service.</p>

        <h2>11. Modifications to Terms</h2>
        <p>We may update these Terms of Service at any time. Continued use of the Service after changes are posted constitutes your acceptance of the revised terms. We will notify users of significant changes through our Discord server or in-game announcements.</p>

        <h2>12. Termination</h2>
        <p>We may terminate or suspend your access to the Service at any time, with or without cause, with or without notice. Upon termination, your license to use the Service ceases immediately. Sections regarding intellectual property, limitation of liability, and virtual items survive termination.</p>

        <h2>13. Contact</h2>
