        <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
        <p class="page-subtitle">Last updated: February 9, 2026</p>

        <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
        <p>By accessing or using Elderos, including the game client, launcher, website, hub, and all related services (collectively, the "Service"), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service ("Terms"), our Privacy Policy, and our Refund Policy. If you do not agree to these Terms, you must stop using the Service immediately and delete all associated software from your devices. Your continued use of the Service constitutes ongoing acceptance of these Terms.</p>

        <h2>2. Eligibility</h2>
        <p>You must be at least 13 years of age to use the Service. By creating an account, you represent and warrant that you meet this age requirement. If you are under 18, you confirm that a parent or legal guardian has reviewed, understood, and agreed to these Terms on your behalf. We reserve the right to terminate accounts if we reasonably believe the user does not meet the age requirement. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 in compliance with COPPA.</p>

        <h2>3. Account Ownership & Responsibility</h2>
        <p>All accounts created on the Service are the property of Elderos and Bad Breath Studios ("we," "us," "our"). You are granted a limited, non-exclusive, revocable, non-transferable license to use your account for personal, non-commercial purposes only.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You may not share, sell, trade, give away, or transfer your account to any other person.</li>
            <li>You are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your login credentials.</li>
            <li>You are responsible for all activity that occurs under your account, whether or not authorized by you.</li>
            <li>You must notify us immediately if you believe your account has been compromised.</li>
            <li>We reserve the right to suspend, restrict, or permanently terminate any account at our sole discretion, with or without cause or prior notice.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Virtual Items, Currency & Digital Goods</h2>
        <p>All virtual items, currency (including but not limited to Eldercoins, vote tokens, and donator tokens), ranks (including donator ranks), cosmetics, and any other in-game assets (collectively, "Virtual Goods") are the sole property of Elderos.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Virtual Goods exist only within the Service and have no real-world monetary value under any circumstances.</li>
            <li>You receive a limited license to use Virtual Goods within the Service — you do not "own" them in any legal sense.</li>
            <li>You may not sell, trade, exchange, or offer to sell, trade, or exchange Virtual Goods for real-world currency, cryptocurrency, goods, or services ("Real-World Trading" or "RWT").</li>
            <li>RWT is strictly prohibited and will result in permanent account termination.</li>
            <li>We may modify, nerf, buff, remove, reset, or otherwise alter any Virtual Goods at any time for balancing, technical, or any other reason, without prior notice or compensation.</li>
            <li>We are not obligated to provide refunds, replacements, or compensation for any changes to Virtual Goods.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. Purchases & Payments</h2>
        <p>All purchases are processed through Stripe, a third-party payment processor. By making a purchase, you also agree to Stripe's terms of service. All purchases of digital goods (including Eldercoins, donator ranks, and any other paid content) are final upon delivery to your account. You acknowledge that digital goods are delivered instantly and that you are purchasing a license to use digital content within the Service, not a tangible product. Prices are listed in the currency displayed at checkout and may change at any time without notice. We reserve the right to modify, discontinue, or change the pricing of any purchasable item at any time. Promotional offers, discounts, or bonus items are provided at our discretion and may be modified or removed at any time.</p>

        <h2>6. Refund Policy</h2>
        <p>Refund eligibility is governed by our separate <a href="/pages/refund.html">Refund Policy</a>. In summary: refunds may be considered within 14 days of purchase if the purchased items have not been used, consumed, traded, or otherwise modified. Refunds are issued at our sole discretion. Used, consumed, or partially consumed items are not eligible for refund. Accounts that have been banned for rule violations are not eligible for refunds. We reserve the right to deny refund requests that we believe are fraudulent or made in bad faith.</p>

        <h2>7. Chargebacks & Payment Disputes</h2>
        <p>If you initiate a chargeback or payment dispute with your bank, credit card company, or payment provider without first contacting us to resolve the issue, your account will be immediately and permanently suspended. We reserve the right to pursue recovery of any funds owed, including the disputed amount plus any fees incurred by us as a result of the chargeback. If you believe a charge was made in error or without your authorization, you must contact us first through our <a href="https://discord.gg/MwkvVMFmfg" target="_blank">Discord server</a> or support channels. Filing a chargeback without first attempting resolution through our support channels is considered a violation of these Terms.</p>

        <h2>8. Acceptable Use</h2>
        <p>When using the Service, you agree not to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Use bots, macros, auto-clickers, scripts, or any third-party software that automates gameplay or interacts with the Service in an unauthorized manner.</li>
            <li>Exploit, abuse, or take advantage of any bugs, glitches, duplications, or unintended game mechanics — you must report such issues to staff immediately.</li>
            <li>Harass, threaten, bully, stalk, or abuse other players or staff members.</li>
            <li>Use offensive, discriminatory, racist, sexist, homophobic, or otherwise hateful language, usernames, or content.</li>

            <li>Distribute, share, or sell the game client, server software, or any proprietary tools or assets.</li>
            <li>Reverse-engineer, decompile, disassemble, or attempt to derive the source code of the game client, launcher, or server software.</li>
            <li>Use the Service for any illegal purpose or in violation of any applicable laws.</li>
            <li>Attempt to interfere with, disrupt, or degrade the performance of the Service, including DDoS attacks, packet flooding, or any form of network attack.</li>
            <li>Advertise, promote, or solicit for other private servers, games, or services within the Service.</li>
            <li>Create multiple accounts to circumvent bans, exploit systems, or gain unfair advantages ("alt abuse").</li>

            <li>Share or distribute private or personal information about other players or staff without their consent ("doxxing").</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>9. Enforcement & Punishments</h2>
        <p>Violations of these Terms or our in-game rules may result in, but are not limited to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Warning</strong> — A formal notice of the violation.</li>

We are not obligated to provide evidence, explain our reasoning, or engage in extended debate regarding enforcement decisions. Our moderation decisions are final. Ban evasion (creating new accounts to circumvent a ban) will result in additional enforcement action against all associated accounts.</p>

        <h2>10. Data Collection & Privacy</h2>

Passwords are cryptographically hashed and are never stored in plaintext. We do not sell your personal information to third parties. We may share information with law enforcement if required by law or if we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect safety.</p>
