        <h1>About Elderos</h1>
        <p class="page-subtitle">OSRS Done Right.</p>

        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>Elderos started with a question: what if Old School RuneScape's economy actually worked? We love OSRS, but after years of playing we couldn't ignore the cracks — bosses flooding the game with raw resources, skilling becoming irrelevant, and end-game content constantly devaluing everything that came before it.</p>
        <p>So we set out to fix it. Not by reinventing the wheel, but by rethinking how the pieces fit together.</p>

        <h2>The Problem With OSRS</h2>
        <p>In OSRS, high-level PvM is the answer to everything. Bosses drop massive quantities of herbs, ores, logs, and other raw resources — things that should come from skilling. As new bosses are added with bigger and better drop tables, those resource prices crash, and the players who actually train Woodcutting, Mining, or Fishing fall further behind.</p>
        <p>The result is an economy where skilling feels pointless and PvM is the only path that matters. That's not the RuneScape we fell in love with.</p>

        <h2>How Elderos Fixes It</h2>
        <p>We redesigned the ecosystem from the ground up. In Elderos, bosses don't drop raw resources. Instead, they drop unique materials and items that <em>skillers</em> need — things that unlock better XP rates, improved yields, or access to new skilling methods.</p>
        <p>This creates a real symbiosis: PvMers need skillers to process and use the materials they earn, and skillers need PvMers to get access to the tools that make their training worthwhile. Neither side is irrelevant, and both drive demand for the other.</p>
        <p>On top of that, we've added new skilling content that integrates seamlessly with OSRS's existing systems. Everything we build feels like it could have shipped in an official update — custom, but natural. No over-the-top custom items or flashy nonsense. Just thoughtful content that makes the game better.</p>

        <h2>What We Believe In</h2>
        <div class="values-grid">
            <div class="value-card">
                <h3>Authenticity</h3>
                <p>We respect the OSRS experience. Our content additions complement the game rather than replacing what makes it great.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="value-card">
                <h3>Quality</h3>
                <p>We'd rather release one polished feature than ten half-finished ones. Every update is tested, refined, and built to last.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="value-card">
                <h3>Community</h3>
                <p>Our players shape the direction of the game. Feedback drives our roadmap, and every voice matters.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="value-card">
                <h3>Fairness</h3>
                <p>No pay-to-win. Donator perks are cosmetic and quality-of-life — never gameplay advantages over free players.</p>
            </div>
