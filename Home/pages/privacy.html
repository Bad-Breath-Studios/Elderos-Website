        <p>Elderos ("we", "us", "our") operates the Elderos game, launcher, website, and related services (collectively, "the Service"). This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, and your rights regarding your data.</p>

        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

        <p>When you create an account, we collect:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Username</strong> — Your chosen display name.</li>
            <li><strong>Email address</strong> — Used for account recovery and important notifications.</li>
            <li><strong>Password</strong> — Stored securely using BCrypt hashing. We never store or see your plain-text password.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Discord Information</h3>
        <p>If you link your Discord account, we store your Discord user ID, username, and avatar hash. This is used for staff authentication, Discord-based features, and community integration.</p>

        <h3>Gameplay Data</h3>

        <h3>Payment Information</h3>
        <p>Payments are processed by <strong>Stripe</strong>. We do not store your credit card number, CVV, or full payment details on our servers. Stripe handles all payment data in compliance with PCI-DSS standards. We receive and store only:</p>

        </ul>

        <h3>Technical Data</h3>

        <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>We use collected information to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Operate and maintain the Service.</li>
            <li>Authenticate your identity and secure your account.</li>
            <li>Process transactions and deliver purchased items.</li>
            <li>Enforce our <a href="/pages/terms.html">Terms of Service</a> and moderate behavior.</li>
            <li>Investigate bugs, abuse, and security incidents.</li>
            <li>Display public leaderboards and hiscores (username, stats, and game mode only).</li>
            <li>Send important account-related notifications.</li>
            <li>Improve the Service based on usage patterns and feedback.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Information Sharing</h2>
        <p>We do not sell your personal information. We may share data only in these circumstances:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Stripe</strong> — Payment processing as described above.</li>
            <li><strong>Legal requirements</strong> — If required by law, court order, or governmental authority.</li>
            <li><strong>Safety</strong> — To protect the rights, safety, or property of our users or the public.</li>

        </ul>

        <h2>4. Data Storage & Security</h2>
        <p>Your data is stored on secured servers. We implement industry-standard security measures including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>BCrypt password hashing with salt.</li>
            <li>JWT-based authentication with expiration.</li>
            <li>HTTPS/TLS encryption for all data in transit.</li>
            <li>Two-factor authentication (TOTP) available for all accounts.</li>
            <li>Rate limiting and IP-based abuse prevention.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>While we take reasonable measures to protect your data, no system is 100% secure. You are responsible for keeping your login credentials confidential.</p>

        <h2>5. Data Retention</h2>
        <p>We retain your account data for as long as your account exists. If your account is banned, we retain associated data for enforcement purposes. Gameplay logs and chat messages are retained for moderation and may be purged periodically at our discretion.</p>

        <h2>6. Your Rights</h2>
        <p>Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have the right to:</p>

        <h2>7. Cookies & Local Storage</h2>
        <p>The Elderos website uses <strong>localStorage</strong> (not traditional cookies) to store your authentication token and account preferences. This data stays on your device and is not sent to third parties. See our <a href="/pages/cookies.html">Cookie Policy</a> for full details.</p>

        <h2>8. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>The Service is not directed at children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If we learn that we have collected data from a child under 13, we will take steps to delete it promptly.</p>

        <h2>9. Third-Party Links</h2>
        <p>The Service may contain links to third-party websites (e.g., Discord, Stripe, YouTube). We are not responsible for the privacy practices of those third parties. We encourage you to review their respective privacy policies.</p>

        <h2>10. Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy at any time. Changes will be posted on this page with an updated "Last updated" date. Continued use of the Service after changes are posted constitutes acceptance.</p>
