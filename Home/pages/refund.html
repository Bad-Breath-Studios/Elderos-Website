        <h1>Refund Policy</h1>
        <p class="page-subtitle">Last updated: February 9, 2026</p>

        <p>This policy outlines the conditions under which refunds may be issued for purchases made through the Elderos in-game store. All payments are processed by Stripe.</p>

        <div class="refund-highlight">
            <p>All purchases on Elderos are for digital goods and are generally considered final once delivered to your account.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>1. Digital Goods</h2>
        <p>Elderos offers digital goods including, but not limited to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Eldercoins</strong> — Virtual currency used within the game.</li>
            <li><strong>Donator Ranks</strong> — Account upgrades that unlock perks and cosmetics.</li>
            <li><strong>Cosmetic Items</strong> — Visual customizations for your character.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These items are delivered instantly to your account upon successful payment. Because of the instant-delivery nature of digital goods, all purchases are considered final.</p>

        <h2>2. Refund Eligibility</h2>
        <p>We may issue a refund in the following circumstances:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Duplicate charge</strong> — You were charged multiple times for the same purchase.</li>
            <li><strong>Items not delivered</strong> — Payment was processed but the items were not credited to your account due to a technical error.</li>
            <li><strong>Unauthorized purchase</strong> — Someone made a purchase on your account without your authorization (evidence required).</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Refund requests must be made within 14 days of the original purchase.</h3>

        <h2>3. Refund Exclusions</h2>
        <p>Refunds will <strong>not</strong> be issued in the following cases:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You changed your mind after purchasing.</li>
            <li>You spent or consumed the purchased items (e.g., Eldercoins used in the store).</li>
            <li>Your account was banned or suspended for violating the <a href="/pages/terms.html">Terms of Service</a>.</li>
            <li>You transferred items purchased with Eldercoins to another player.</li>
            <li>More than 14 days have passed since the purchase.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Chargebacks & Disputes</h2>
        <p>Filing a chargeback or payment dispute with your bank or payment provider without first contacting us will result in an immediate and permanent ban of your account. If you believe a charge is incorrect, please contact us first so we can resolve the issue.</p>
        <div class="refund-highlight">
            <p>Always contact us before disputing a charge with your bank. We are happy to resolve legitimate issues quickly.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>5. How to Request a Refund</h2>
        <p>To request a refund:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Join our <a href="https://discord.gg/MwkvVMFmfg" target="_blank">Discord server</a>.</li>
            <li>Open a support ticket in the appropriate channel.</li>
            <li>Provide your <strong>username</strong>, <strong>transaction ID</strong> (from your email receipt), and a <strong>description of the issue</strong>.</li>
            <li>Our team will review your request and respond within 72 hours.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>6. Refund Processing</h2>
        <p>Approved refunds are processed through Stripe back to the original payment method. Processing times depend on your bank or card provider, but typically take 5-10 business days after approval.</p>
        <p>When a refund is issued, the corresponding digital items will be removed from your account. If items have already been used, we may deduct the equivalent value from your account balance.</p>

        <h2>7. Account Termination</h2>
        <p>If your account is terminated for violating our Terms of Service, you are not entitled to a refund for any prior purchases. Maintaining account access is contingent on following the rules.</p>

        <h2>8. Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Refund Policy at any time. Changes take effect upon posting. Continued purchases after changes are posted constitute acceptance of the revised policy.</p>

        <h2>9. Contact</h2>
        <p>For refund inquiries, contact us via our <a href="https://discord.gg/MwkvVMFmfg" target="_blank">Discord server</a> or <a href="/pages/contact.html">Contact page</a>.</p>
